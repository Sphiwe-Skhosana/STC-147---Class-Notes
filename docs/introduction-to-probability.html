<p>Now that you have learned about data, how to collect it and summarise
it, you are now ready to make use of the sample data to draw meaningful
conclusions about the sampled population. This process is referred to as
<strong>inferential statistics</strong> and the essential statistical tool involved
in this process is called <strong>probability</strong>. At its core, probability is a
measure of our <strong>uncertainty</strong>. Everyday we are faced with
decision-making and probability statements. Statements involving words
such as <em>chance</em>, <em>likelihood</em>, <em>odds</em>, <em>likely</em>, <em>expected</em>,
<em>possibility</em> and <em>probably</em> are all addressing the same issue:
uncertainty. Every day we say, read or hear statements such as the
following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>There is a 75% <em>chance</em> of rain today.</li>
<li>What is the <em>likelihood</em> we will a test today?</li>
<li>I will <em>probably</em> pass this course.</li>
<li>The <em>odds</em> are 1 in 100 million that you will be struck by
lightning.</li>
<li>If a single fair coin is tossed, there is a 50-50 <em>possibility</em> that
a head will occur.</li>
</ol>
<p>In statistics, probability allows you to evaluate the reliability of
your conclusions about the population when you have only information
from the sample data. Consider the example 5. of tossing a coin once,
the outcome will be either a head (H) or a tail (T). Suppose, as is true
in reality, that you don’t know whether or not the coin is fair. You
decide to perform a simple experiment by tossing the coin <span class="math inline">\(n=10\)</span> times
and observe <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> heads in a row. Can you conclude that the coin is fair?
Probably not, because a fair coin is <em>very unlikely</em> to yield <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> heads
in a row. It is more likely that the coin is biased.</p>
<p>As with the coin-tossing example, in statistics we use probability in
two ways. When the population is known (e.g. the coin is known to be
fair), probability is used to describe the chance of observing a
particular sample outcome. When the population is unknown (e.g. it is
unknown whether or not the coin is fair) and only a sample from the
population is available, probability is used to make statements about
the population. The latter case is more likely in practice. This is the
inferential statistics we referred to above.</p>
<p>You know have an intuitive feeling for probability. In this chapter, we
build on this intuition by presenting the basic mathematical concepts of
probability along with some real-world examples.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Sample space<a href="introduction-to-probability.html#sample-space" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>We introduce the concept of an <strong>experiment</strong> as any action or process
that results in well-defined observations or outcomes. On any single
repetition or <strong>trial</strong> of an experiment, one and only one possible
outcome will occur. The following are examples of experiments and their
possible outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experiment</strong>: Observing the gender of a new born baby;
<strong>Outcomes</strong>: Male, Female</li>
<li><strong>Experiment</strong>: Toss a coin; <strong>Outcomes</strong>: Head, Tail</li>
<li><strong>Experiment</strong>: Selecting a part for inspection; <strong>Outcomes</strong>:
Defective, Non-defective</li>
<li><strong>Experiment</strong>: Conducting a sales call; <strong>Outcomes</strong>: Purchase,
No-Purchase</li>
<li><strong>Experiment</strong>: Rolling a die; <strong>Outcomes</strong>: 1,2,3,4,5,6</li>
<li><strong>Experiment</strong>: Play a football game; <strong>Outcomes</strong>: Win, Lose, Tie</li>
</ul>
<p>The outcomes of most experiments are uncertain. A set or collection of
all possible outcomes of an experiment is called a <strong>sample space</strong> and
it is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.<br />
The simplest experiment is one that has only two possible outcomes.
Consider the first experiment above of observing the gender of a new
born baby. The sample space for this experiment is given by <span class="math inline">\(S=\{M,F\}\)</span>,
where <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> represents male and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> represents female. Suppose that we
observed the births of two new born babies, then the sample space is
given by <span class="math inline">\(S_1=\{MM,MF,FM,FF\}\)</span>, where, for instance, <span class="math inline">\(MF\)</span> indicates that
the first baby born was male and the second baby born was female.
Another possible sample space for this experiment might consist of the
number of possible male births, <span class="math inline">\(S_2=\{0,1,2\}\)</span>. As a last example,
consider the experiment of rolling a six-sided die, here the sample
space is given by <span class="math inline">\(S_1=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\)</span>. Another sample space for this
experiment might consist of whether the number facing up is even or odd,
<span class="math inline">\(S_2=\{E,O\}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> represents an even number and <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> represents an
odd number.</p>
<div class="example">

<p>In the study of probability, we are often interested in determining the
likelihood of the occurrence of a collection of outcomes instead of the
likelihood of the occurrence of a single outcome. For instance, in an
experiment where three coins are tossed once, we might be interested in
the outcomes which indicate that at least two heads are observed. This
collection of outcomes denoted by <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A={HHT,HTH,THH,HHH}\)</span>, is called
an <strong>event</strong>. An <strong>event</strong> is any collection or subset of the sample
space. An event is said to be <strong>simple</strong> if it consists of exactly one
outcome and <strong>compound</strong> if it consists of more than one outcome. When
an experiment is performed, a particular event, say <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, is said to
occur if the resulting outcome is contained in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider the experiment of tossing a R5 coin followed by a R1 coin. A
sample space for this experiment could be <span class="math inline">\(S=\{HH,HT,TH,HH\}\)</span>. Some
possible events are</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
E_1=\{HH\}\hspace{1cm}E_4=\{HH,TT\}\\
E_2=\{HT\}\hspace{1cm}E_5=\{HT,TH\}\\
E_3=\{TH\}\hspace{1cm}E_6=\{TT\}
\end{equation}
\]</span> Events <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(E_3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_6\)</span> are simple events and events
<span class="math inline">\(E_4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_5\)</span> are compound events. There are actually a total of 16
possible events for the above experiment. As an exercise, identify the
other events. Note that the <strong>empty set</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\emptyset\)</span> and the sample
space <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> are also events. The event <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E_1}\)</span> can be described as
getting a tail on the R5 and a tail on the R1. The event <span class="math inline">\(E_4\)</span> can be
described as getting two heads or two tails. As an exercise, describe
the remaining events.</p>
<div class="example">

<p>We next turn to the main question of this section which is on how to
assign probabilities to events. There are two general methods for
assigning probabilities to events: the objective method and the
subjective method. The <strong>objective method</strong> involves assigning
probabilities to events based on counting or repeated experiments. On
the other hand, the objective method involves assigning probabilities to
events based on intuition or personal belief. We now discuss each method
in turn.</p>
</div>
<div id="objective-method" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Objective method<a href="introduction-to-probability.html#objective-method" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Consider an experiment that can be repeatedly performed in an identical
and independent fashion and let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be an event consisting of a fixed
set of outcomes of the experiment. Simple examples of repeatable
experiments include tossing a coin and rolling a die. If the experiment
is performed <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times, on some of the replications the event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> will
occur and on some <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> will not occur. Let <span class="math inline">\(n(A)\)</span> denote the number of
replications on which <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> does occur. Then the ratio <span class="math inline">\(n(A)/n\)</span> is called
the <strong>relative frequency</strong> of occurrence of the event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
replications. The empirical evidence based on the results of many of the
sequences of repeatable experiments indicate that as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> becomes large,
the relative frequency stabilizes. That is, as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> gets large, the
relative frequency approaches a limiting value referred to as the
limiting relative frequency of the event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. The objective method of
assigning probability identifies this limiting relative frequency with
<span class="math inline">\(P(A)\)</span>. Thus, if an experiment is repeatable, we can assign
probabilities to the outcomes in accordance with their limiting relative
frequencies. As an example, The table below contains the number of heads
obtained when a fair coin was tossed <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times, as well as the relative
frequency <span class="math inline">\(n(H)/n\)</span> for the number of heads obtained in each case. It is
clear from the table that the limiting value of the relative frequency
of obtaining a head when a coin is tossed <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times will approach <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span>
as <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> becomes large. Therefore, the probability of <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, obtaining a
head, is <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="Figures/Relative_Frequency_Example.png" width="298" /></p>
<p>The only problem with this approach is that the limiting relative
frequencies of events are not always known. In order to use this method,
we need to have repetitive data available and then use it to approximate
the relative frequency limits. Probabilities obtained using this
approach are said to be <strong>empirical</strong>. According to the empirical
approach to probability, if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is an event, <span class="math inline">\(P(A)\)</span> is approximately
equal to <span class="math inline">\(f/n\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the number of favorable outcomes and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is
the number of repetitions of the experiment. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(P(A)\approx f/n\)</span>.
For example, consider again the coin-tossing experiment in Table. The
relative frequency can serve as an estimate of the probability <span class="math inline">\(P(H)\)</span>.
To get a better estimate, we could consider tossing the coin <span class="math inline">\(3000\)</span> or
<span class="math inline">\(5000\)</span> times or even more.</p>

<p>If an experiment has a finite number, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, of outcomes that we believe
are equally likely to occur, we can assign each outcome in the sample
space <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> a probability value of <span class="math inline">\(1/n\)</span>. This is a consequence of the
second property of a probability, which states that the sum of the
probabilities for a sample space must be <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Then if <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is an event
containing <span class="math inline">\(n(E)\)</span> outcomes, the probability of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> occurring is simply
<span class="math inline">\(n(E)/n\)</span>. Thus, we have the following basic fact:</p>
<p>*If <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is a sample space of <strong>equally likely outcomes</strong>, then
<span class="math inline">\(P(E)=n(E)/n\)</span>,</p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(n(E)\)</span> is the number of outcomes in <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of
outcomes in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.</p>
<p>The objective method for assigning probabilities using sample spaces of
equally likely outcomes is referred to as the <strong>classical probability
method</strong>.</p>

<p>The objective method of assigning probabilities is limited to
experimental situations that are repeatable. However, many real-world
experimental situations are unrepeatable. For instance, the chances of a
peace agreement in the Russia-Ukraine war. Thus, we have limited or no
information concerning the outcomes of an experiment. We must therefore
adopt an alternative interpretation of a probability. In such
situations, probabilities are assigned based on experience or expert
knowledge. For instance, a doctor treating a patient with a rare disease
must make a prognosis based on his experience with the patient and the
patient’s overall medical record. When probabilities are assigned to
events based on intuition and personal beliefs, the assignment method is
called <strong>subjective</strong>. Because different people may have different prior
information and opinions concerning a given experimental situation,
probability assignment will differ from individual to individual.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Basic counting rules<a href="introduction-to-probability.html#basic-counting-rules" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Whenever the outcomes of an experiment are equally likely (that is, the
same probability is assigned to each simple event in the sample space),
a necessary step towards assigning probabilities is being able to count.
Suppose that an experiment has <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> possible outcomes and <span class="math inline">\(n(A)\)</span> is the
number of experimental outcomes contained in event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, then
<span class="math inline">\(P(A)=n(A)/n\)</span>. If all the experimental outcomes are available or can be
listed, then <span class="math inline">\(n(A)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> can be obtained without the use of counting
rules. However, many experiments involve constructing lists of outcomes
in which <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n(A)\)</span> are prohibitively large. Fortunately, for such
experiments, we can use some basic counting rules to calculate
probabilities without listing the experimental outcomes.</p>
<div id="the-fundamental-counting-rule" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.5.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1</span> The Fundamental counting rule<a href="introduction-to-probability.html#the-fundamental-counting-rule" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The first counting rule we discuss is referred to the <strong>fundamental
counting rule</strong> and it applies to experiments with multiple steps.
Consider an experiment in which five coins are tossed. Let the
experimental outcomes be defined in terms of the patterns of heads and
tails appearing on the upward faces of each of the five coins. What is
the total number of experimental outcomes? Let <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> denote a head
and a tail, respectively, <span class="math inline">\((H,H,H,H,H)\)</span> indicates the experimental
outcome with a head on the first coin, second coin, third coin, fourth
coin and fifth coin. As can be seen, it is a cumbersome task to list all
of the experimental outcomes in the sample space <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. To help us
calculate the total number of experimental outcomes without listing
them, the experiment of tossing the five coins can be thought of as a
five-step experiment: In the first step, the first coin is tossed; in
the second step, the second coin is tossed; in the third step, the third
coin is tossed; in the fourth step, the fourth coin is tossed and in the
fifth step, the fifth coin is tossed. We can make use of the fundamental
counting rule to determine the number of experimental outcomes.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p><span id="thm:label" class="theorem"><strong>Theorem 2.1  (Fundamental Counting Rule) </strong></span>If an experiment can be described as a sequence of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> steps with <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> possible outcomes on the first step, <span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span> possible outcomes on the second step, and so on, then the total number of exeprimental outcomes is given by <span class="math inline">\(n_1\times n_2 \times \dots \times n_k\)</span>.</p>

<p>Looking at the experiment of tossing five coins as a sequence of first

followed by the third coin (<span class="math inline">\(n_3=2\)</span>), followed by the fourth coin
(<span class="math inline">\(n_4=2\)</span>) and then the last coin (<span class="math inline">\(n_5=2\)</span>), we can see from the
fundamental counting rule that there are
<span class="math inline">\(2\times 2\times 2\times 2\times 2=32\)</span> experimental outcomes.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:ex12" class="example"><strong>Example 2.12  </strong></span>Consider the experiment of going to a store to buy a new phone. Once

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> The experiment has three steps: The first step (Step 1)
involves choosing one of the <span class="math inline">\(n_1=4\)</span> models, the second step (Step 2)
involves choosing one of the <span class="math inline">\(n_2=5\)</span> battery options and the third step

all the outcomes of a multiple-step experiment can be constructed using
a <em>tree diagram</em>. Suppose that, in the above coin-tossing experiment, we
only tossed two coins. Figure <a href="introduction-to-probability.html#fig:fig5">2.4</a> displays a tree diagram
for the experiment of tossing two coins. The sequence of steps moves
from the left to right. The first step (Step 1) involves tossing the
first coin and the second step (Step 2) involves tossing the second
coin. For each step, there are two possible outcomes: head (<span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>) or tail
(<span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>). Note that each possible outcome in the first step is associated
with two branches in the second step. The points (e.g. <span class="math inline">\((H,H)\)</span>) on the
right side of the tree corresponds to the experimental outcomes. Each
path from the leftmost node of the tree to the rightmost node of the
tree results in a single experimental outcome.</p>

<p>The third counting rule is useful when an experiment involves selecting
a subset of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> elements from a fixed set of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct elements in
such a way that the order of selection is important. Thus, the same <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>
elements selected in a different order are considered a different
experimental outcome. The resulting ordered sequence of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> elements is
called a <strong>permutation</strong>. The number of permutations of size <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> from
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct elements, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(P^n_k\)</span>, can be calculated using the
fundamental counting rule. The first element can be chosen in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> ways,
the second in <span class="math inline">\((n-1)\)</span> ways and the <span class="math inline">\(k^{th}\)</span> element in <span class="math inline">\((n-(r-1))\)</span> ways.
Thus,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(P^n_k=n(n-1)(n-2)\times\dots\times(n-k+2)(n-k+1)\)</span></p>
<p>Using the factorial notation,

<p><strong>Solution</strong> The experiment consists of randomly selecting three

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> Conditional probabilities<a href="introduction-to-probability.html#conditional-probabilities" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Most of the time, the probability of an event is influenced by whether
or not a related event has already occurred. The probability of an event
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> occurring when we know that event <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> has already occurred is called
a <strong>conditional probability</strong> and it is written as <span class="math inline">\(P(A|B)\)</span>. We use the
notation <span class="math inline">\(|\)</span> to indicate that we are considering the probability of
event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> given the condition that event <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> has occurred. Hence, the
notation <span class="math inline">\(P(A|B)\)</span> reads “the probability of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>”. As an
illustration of the application of conditional probability, we consider
a study that was undertaken at a certain university to determine what
relationship, if any, exists between mathematics ability and interest in
mathematics. The ability and interest for <span class="math inline">\(150\)</span> students were determined
with the results summarized in the following table:</p>
<p><img src="Figures/Example_Conditional.png" width="1618" /></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(L_1=\)</span> the event that a student has a Low interest in mathematics
<span class="math inline">\(A_1=\)</span> the event that a student has a Average interest in mathematics
<span class="math inline">\(H_1=\)</span> the event that a student has a High interest in mathematics
<span class="math inline">\(L_2=\)</span> the event that a student has a Low ability in mathematics <span class="math inline">\(A_2=\)</span>
the event that a student has a Average ability in mathematics <span class="math inline">\(H_2=\)</span> the
event that a student has a High ability in mathematics</p>
<p>Dividing the data values in the table by 150, we obtain
<span class="math inline">\(P(L_1\cap L_2)=40/150=\)</span>, the probability that a student has a low
interest and low ability in mathematics. <span class="math inline">\(P(L_1\cap A_2)=8/150=\)</span>, the
probability that a student has a low interest and average ability in
mathematics. <span class="math inline">\(P(L_1\cap H_2)=12/150=\)</span>, the probability that a student
has a low interest and high ability in mathematics.
<span class="math inline">\(P(A_1\cap L_2)=15/150=\)</span>, the probability that a student has an average
interest and low ability in mathematics. <span class="math inline">\(P(A_1\cap A_2)=17/150=\)</span>, the
probability that a student has a average interest and average ability in
mathematics. <span class="math inline">\(P(A_1\cap H_2)=18/150=\)</span>, the probability that a student
has an average interest and high ability in mathematics.
<span class="math inline">\(P(H_1\cap L_2)=5/150=\)</span>, the probability that a student has a high
interest and low ability in mathematics. <span class="math inline">\(P(H_1\cap A_2)=10/150=\)</span>, the
probability that a student has a high interest and average ability in
mathematics. <span class="math inline">\(P(H_1\cap H_2)=25/150=\)</span>, the probability that a student
has a high interest and high ability in mathematics.</p>
<p>Since each of these values give the probabilities of the intersection of
two events, the probabilities are called <strong>joint probabilities</strong>. Table
<a href="#fig7"><strong>??</strong></a> is referred to as the <em>joint probability table</em>. The table
gives a summary of the probability information.</p>
<div class="figure"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:fig7"></span>
<img src="Figures/Example_Conditional2.png" alt="Joint probability table for the mathematics interest and ability study" width="212" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 2.5: Joint probability table for the mathematics interest and ability study
</p>
</div>
<p>The values in the margins of the joint probability table provide the
probabilities of each event separately. That is, <span class="math inline">\(P(L_1)=0.4000\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(P(A_1)=0.2333\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P(H_1)=0.3667\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P(L_2)=0.4000\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P(A_2)=0.3333\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(P(H_2)=0.2667\)</span>. These probabilities are referred to as <strong>marginal
probabilities</strong> because of their location in the margins of the joint
probability table. Note that the marginal probabilities are obtained by
summing the joint probabilities in the corresponding row or column of
the joint probability table. For example, the marginal probability of
having a high ability in mathematics is
<span class="math inline">\(P(H_1)=P(H_1\cap L2)+P(H_1\cap A2)+P(H_1\cap H2)=0.0333+0.0667+0.1667=0.2667\)</span>.\
We now turn to our initial task of assessing whether or not there is a
relationship between mathematics ability and interest. We first
calculate the conditional probability that a randomly selected student
has a low ability in mathematics given that the student has a low
interest in mathematics. In mathematical notation, we want to calculate
<span class="math inline">\(P(L_2|L_1)\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(P(L_2|L_1)\)</span> means that we are interested in the
probability of <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> given that we only have <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> (that is, the student
has a low interest in mathematics). Thus, <span class="math inline">\(P(L_2|L_1)\)</span> means that we are
only concerned with the mathematics ability of the <span class="math inline">\(60\)</span> students who
have a low interest in mathematics. Since <span class="math inline">\(40\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(60\)</span> students have
a low mathematics ability, <span class="math inline">\(P(L_2|L_1)=40/60=2/3=0.6667\)</span>. Thus, given
that a student has a low interest in mathematics, there is a <span class="math inline">\(67\%\)</span>
probability that the student has a low mathematics ability.\ We have
shown that <span class="math inline">\(P(L_2|L_1)=40/60=0.6667\)</span>. Dividing both the numerator and
denominator of this fraction by <span class="math inline">\(150\)</span>, the total number of students in
the study, we get <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
P(L_2|L_1)=\frac{40}{60}=\frac{40/150}{60/150}=\frac{0.2667}{0.4000}=0.6667
\end{aligned}
\]</span> We can see that <span class="math inline">\(P(L_2|L_1)\)</span> can be calculated as <span class="math inline">\(0.2667/0.4000\)</span>.
Referring to the joint probability table (Table <a href="#fig4"><strong>??</strong></a>), we can see
that <span class="math inline">\(0.2667\)</span> is the probability <span class="math inline">\(P(L_1\cap L_2)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0.4000\)</span> is the
probability <span class="math inline">\(P(L_1)\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(P(L_2|L_1)\)</span> can be expressed as a
ratio of the joint probability <span class="math inline">\(P(L_1\cap L_2)\)</span> to the marginal
probability <span class="math inline">\(P(L_1)\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
P(L_2|L_1)=\frac{P(L_1\cap L_2)}{P(L_1)}=\frac{0.2667}{0.4000}=0.6667
\end{aligned}
\]</span> This leads to the following general formula for calculating
conditional probabilities. For any two events <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[
\begin{eqnarray}
P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}\\
\text{or}\\
P(B|A)=\frac{A\cap B}{P(A)}
\end{eqnarray}
\]</span> The Venn diagram in Figure @(fig:fig8) illustrates concept of a
conditional probability. The circle on the right shows that event <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>
has occurred; the portion of the circle that overlaps with event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
denotes the event <span class="math inline">\((A\cap B)\)</span>. We know that once event <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> has occurred,
the only way that we can also observe event A is for the event
<span class="math inline">\((A\cap B)\)</span> to occur. Thus, the ratio <span class="math inline">\(P(A\cap B)/P(B)\)</span> provides the
conditional probability that we will observe event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> given that event
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> has already occurred.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.7.1</span> Independent events<a href="introduction-to-probability.html#independent-events" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>We now introduce the concept of <strong>independent</strong> events. Two events, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are said to be independent if <span class="math inline">\(P(A|B)=P(A)\)</span>, otherwise, they are
said to be dependent. The idea behind the independence of events is that
the knowledge that the event <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> has occurred will have no influence on
whether or not the event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> will occur. In other words, the happening
of one event (<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>) does not affect the happening of the other event
(<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>), vice versa. In our example, we can see that <span class="math inline">\(P(L_2)=0.4000\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(P(L_2|L_1)=0.6667\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P(L_2|A_1)=0.0533/0.2333=0.2285\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(P(L_2|H_1)=0.0800/0.3667=0.2182\)</span>. Thus, we see that the probability of
a low ability in mathematics is affected by the level of interest the
student has in mathematics. That is, <span class="math inline">\(P(L_2|L_1)\neq P(L_2)\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(P(L_2|A_1)\neq P(L_2)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(L_2|H_1)\neq P(L_2)\)</span>. Therefore, we can
say that the events <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> are dependent, the same applies to
events <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> as well as the events <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>. Finally,
we can use these results to solve our initial task, which is to assess
the relationship, if any, between a student’s interest and ability in
mathematics. Since the events, <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_1\)</span>, are dependent, we can say that there is a relationship
between a student’s interest in mathematics and their ultimate ability
in mathematics.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.7.2</span> Multiplication rule<a href="introduction-to-probability.html#multiplication-rule" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>From the definition of conditional probability, we can obtain the
following result <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
P(A\cap B)=P(A|B)\times P(B)
\end{aligned}
\]</span> or <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
P(A\cap B)=P(B|A)\times P(A)
\end{aligned}
\]</span> This is referred to as the <strong>multiplication rule</strong>. The
multiplication rule is useful for calculating the probability of the
intersection of two events. This rule is also important because often,
say <span class="math inline">\(P(A)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(A|B)\)</span>, are given and we want to obtain <span class="math inline">\(P(A\cap B)\)</span>.
This is demonstrated in the following example.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:ex19" class="example"><strong>Example 2.19  </strong></span>Consider a newspaper circulation department where it is known that
<span class="math inline">\(84\%\)</span> of the households in a particular neighborhood subscribe to the

household subscribes to the daily edition, <span class="math inline">\(P(D) = .84\)</span>. In addition, it
is known that the probability that a household that already holds a

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Using the multiplication rule, we compute the desired
<span class="math inline">\(P(S\cap D)\)</span> as <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
P(S\cap D)=P(D)P(S | D)=.84(.75)=.63

\]</span> We now know that <span class="math inline">\(63\%\)</span> of the households subscribe to both the

<p>Consider an experiment of rolling a die and define the two events:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(E=\)</span> the event of observing an even number <span class="math inline">\(E^c\)</span> the event of observing
an odd number</p>
<p>Taken together, event <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E^c\)</span> make up the sample space <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>,
consisting of all the possible number of points facing up, that is
<span class="math inline">\(\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\)</span>. Since a prime number can be either even (2) or
odd(1,3,5), the event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, which is that the number facing up is a prime
number consists of both those simple events in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> <strong>and</strong> <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and those
simple events in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E^c\)</span>. Since these two events are mutually
exclusive, we can write the event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
B=(B\cap E)\cup(B\cap E^c)
\end{aligned}
\]</span> and</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(P(B)=P(B\cap E)+P(B\cap E^c)=1/6+3/6=2/3=0.6667\)</span></p>
<p>Suppose now that the sample space can be partitioned into <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>
sub-populations, <span class="math inline">\(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_k\)</span>, that are mutually exclusive and
exhaustive. Events are said to be exhaustive if one <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> must occur,
such that <span class="math inline">\(A_1\cup A_2\cup\dots\cup A_k=S\)</span>. As above, the event <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> can
be expressed as <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
B=(B\cap A_1)\cup(B\cap A_2)\cup\dots\cup(B\cap A_k)
\end{aligned}
\]</span> Then,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
P(B)=P(B\cap A_1)+P(B\cap A_2)+\dots+P(B\cap A_k)

<p>We can go one step further and use the multiplication rule to write

<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-2" class="example"><strong>Example 2.20  (Oil Change) </strong></span>The members of a consulting firm rent cars from three rental agencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(60\%\)</span> from agency 1</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(30\%\)</span> from agency 2</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(10\%\)</span> from agency 3</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math inline">\(9\%\)</span> of the cars from agency 1 need an oil change, <span class="math inline">\(20\%\)</span> of the cars
from agency 2 need an oil change and <span class="math inline">\(6\%\)</span> of the cars from agency 3
need an oil change. Calculate the probability that a rental car
delivered to the firm will need an oil change.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(B=\)</span> the event that a rental car needs an oil change</p>
<p>We have the partition:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(A_1=\)</span> the event that a car comes from agency 1</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(A_2=\)</span> the event that a car comes from agency 2</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(A_3=\)</span> the event that a car comes from agency 3</li>
</ul>
<p>We have the following probabilities:</p>
<p>By the law of total probability, the probability that a rental car
delivered to the firm will need an oil change is: <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
P(B)&amp;=&amp;P(B|A_1)P(A_1)+P(B|A_2)P(A_2)+P(B|A_3)P(A_3)\\
&amp;=&amp;0.09(0.6)+0.2(0.3)+0.06(0.1)\\
&amp;=&amp;0.12
\end{eqnarray}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Now, suppose that we know that a car delivered to the firm needs an oil
change, what is the probability that the rental car came from Agency 2?
This probability can be obtained by the Bayes’ Theorem.</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(P(A_j|B)=\frac{P(A_j\cap B)}{P(B)}=\frac{P(B|A_j)P(A_j)}{\sum^k_{i=1}P(B|A_i)P(A_i)}\)</span>
for <span class="math inline">\(j=1,2,\dots,k\)</span></p>

<p>Now, we return to the above question.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-3" class="example"><strong>Example 2.21  (Oil Change-Continued) </strong></span>Suppose that we know that a rental car delivered to the firm needs an
